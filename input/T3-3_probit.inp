TITLE:	this is an example of a Logistic regression
        for a binary or categorical observed
        dependent variable with two covariates
DATA:	FILE = "../data/test.dat";
VARIABLE:	NAMES ARE u1 x1 x3;
            USEVARIABLES ARE u1 x1 x3;
	        CATEGORICAL = u1;  ! 定义计算变量
!ANALYSIS:   ESTIMATOR = ML; 加上此行为LOGISTIC回归，去除则为PROBIT回归
MODEL:	u1 ON x1 x3;

OUTPUT:  SAMPSTAT Standardized;
